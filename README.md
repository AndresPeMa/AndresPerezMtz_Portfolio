### 1.- USING MACHINE LEARNING TO IMPROVE TREATMENT TARGETING IN FARMER TRAINING

**California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. Winter Quarter 2023 + Spring Quarter 2023**

**Description**
> Cal Poly's Masters of Science in Quantitative Economics program project collaboration with the World Bank IFC branch. A 6-month long project where my team and I worked on analyzing farming techniques in Cambodia and Ethiopia and developed multiple machine learning models (Ridge, Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Network) to compare results between the countries, improve treatment targeting in farmer training, and see the lasting effects of new training techniques.

**Technical Skills**
> Python, R Studio, Stata, Markdown, Git, GitHub, Excel, LaTeX, Microsoft Office

### 2.- COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY PRICES IN SAN DIEGO AND SACRAMENTO COUNTIES

**California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. Spring Quarter 2023**

**Description**

> Group project which consisted of gathering housing price data in two different California counties (San Diego and Sacramento), running various time series tests on the data, and comparing results. We then visualized the data and tests to present it to the class and provide them in our project report.

**Technical Skills**

> R-Studio, Python, Excel, Microsoft Office

### 3.- THE ECONOMICS OF POPULATION GROWTH AND IMMIGRATION ON UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN CALIFORNIA

**California State University, Sacramento. Spring semester 2022**

**Description** 

> This individual project consisted of picking a topic of my interest for which we needed to research previous literature, look for and gather enough data to run tests (OLS regression, statistical tests), analyze it, write a report, and present it to the Sacramento State economics faculty.

**Challenges**

> This was the very first big project I had to do individually. To my surprise, finding a reputable data source with enough observation to make my results statistically significant was not easy, so I had to make a few compromises. Once I obtained data with enough observations, I had to clean the data set and get rid of outliers, as this would throw off my regression results and tests. Lastly, I ran a basic OLS regression, performed a few statistical tests on the data, and wrote a 20-page report on my results. This was also my first time presenting a complex project to a big audience, so I had to practice and get used to explaining my results to classmates and economics faculty.
